# k-means_algorithm, using numpy
machine learning task

in this task, the k-means algorithm is implemented in order to recognize a picture by its pixels. 
the k values are taken from values : 2,4,8,16. 

for each value there are 10 classifying iterations. the centroids were given.

for each K, the initial value of every centroid is printed , then, after a "learning session" the current centroid values are printed too.
